  abstract = {Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with atmospheric concentrations that have nearly tripled since pre-industrial times. Wetlands account for a large share of global CH4 emissions, yet the magnitude and factors controlling CH4 fluxes in tidal wetlands remain uncertain. We synthesized CH4 flux data from 100 chamber and 9 eddy covariance (EC) sites across tidal marshes in the conterminous United States to assess controlling factors and improve predictions of CH4 emissions. This effort included creating an open-source database of chamber-based GHG fluxes (https://doi.org/10.25573/serc.14227085). Annual fluxes across chamber and EC sites averaged 26 {\textpm} 53 g CH4 m-2 year-1, with a median of 3.9 g CH4 m-2 year-1, and only 25\% of sites exceeding 18 g CH4 m-2 year-1. The highest fluxes were observed at fresh-oligohaline sites with daily maximum temperature normals (MATmax) above 25.6{$^\circ$}C. These were followed by frequently inundated low and mid-fresh-oligohaline marshes with MATmax {$\leq$}25.6{$^\circ$}C, and mesohaline sites with MATmax {$>$}19{$^\circ$}C. Quantile regressions of paired chamber CH4 flux and porewater biogeochemistry revealed that the 90th percentile of fluxes fell below 5 {\textpm} 3 nmol m-2 s-1 at sulfate concentrations {$>$}4.7 {\textpm} 0.6 mM, porewater salinity {$>$}21 {\textpm} 2 psu, or surface water salinity {$>$}15 {\textpm} 3 psu. Across sites, salinity was the dominant predictor of annual CH4 fluxes, while within sites, temperature, gross primary productivity (GPP), and tidal height controlled variability at diel and seasonal scales. At the diel scale, GPP preceded temperature in importance for predicting CH4 flux changes, while the opposite was observed at the seasonal scale. Water levels influenced the timing and pathway of diel CH4 fluxes, with pulsed releases of stored CH4 at low to rising tide. This study provides data and methods to improve tidal marsh CH4 emission estimates, support blue carbon assessments, and refine national and global GHG inventories.},

  abstract = {Support for coastal wetland restoration projects that consider carbon (C) storage as a climate mitigation benefit is growing as coastal wetlands are sites of substantial C sequestration. However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH4). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with 210Pb-derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on-site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (-280 {\textpm} 90 and -350 {\textpm} 150 g C m-2 yr-1). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 {\textpm} 19 g C m-2 yr-1) that accounted for {$\sim$}13\%--23\% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a {$>$} 10 times higher CO2-sequestration to CH4-emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 {\textpm} 2.0 to 8 {\textpm} 4 decades.},

  abstract = {Wetlands cover a small portion of the world, but have disproportionate influence on global carbon (C) sequestration, carbon dioxide and methane emissions, and aquatic C fluxes. However, the underlying biogeochemical processes that affect wetland C pools and fluxes are complex and dynamic, making measurements of wetland C challenging. Over decades of research, many observational, experimental, and analytical approaches have been developed to understand and quantify pools and fluxes of wetland C. Sampling approaches range in their representation of wetland C from short to long timeframes and local to landscape spatial scales. This review summarizes common and cutting-edge methodological approaches for quantifying wetland C pools and fluxes. We first define each of the major C pools and fluxes and provide rationale for their importance to wetland C dynamics. For each approach, we clarify what component of wetland C is measured and its spatial and temporal representativeness and constraints. We describe practical considerations for each approach, such as where and when an approach is typically used, who can conduct the measurements (expertise, training requirements), and how approaches are conducted, including considerations on equipment complexity and costs. Finally, we review key covariates and ancillary measurements that enhance the interpretation of findings and facilitate model development. The protocols that we describe to measure soil, water, vegetation, and gases are also relevant for related disciplines such as ecology. Improved quality and consistency of data collection and reporting across studies will help reduce global uncertainties and develop management strategies to use wetlands as nature-based climate solutions.},

  abstract = {Dike material was used as fill to construct high, mid, and low intertidal elevations in a subsided marsh located in the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, Oregon. Marsh surface elevation change (including fill consolidation and compression of the original marsh soils), vertical accretion, tidal channel development, emergent vegetation colonization, and fish use were monitored over 3 years. Significant marsh surface elevation loss was detected at all elevations, with fill consolidation accounting for 70\% of the loss at the highest elevation. Vertical accretion averaged 0.19 cm/yr in the sparsely vegetated Kunz Marsh compared with 0.70 cm/yr at the densely vegetated reference sites. Tidal channel development was influenced as much by marsh surface gradient as by marsh surface elevation. Vegetation colonization was directly correlated with elevation, whereas density and species richness of fish was inversely correlated with elevation. Manipulating the marsh surface to mid-marsh elevations favors rapid vegetation colonization and facilitates vertical accretion-dominated tidal channel development. Low marsh elevations result in initially slower developing vegetation colonization and channel development but are more beneficial to fish during the early stages of marsh recovery. High marsh elevations appear to sacrifice tidal channel development and associated fish access for rapid vegetation colonization.},

Drivers of CH4 emissions from blue C ecosystems and effects of global change are poorly understood. Here we test for the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and its interactions with elevated atmospheric CO2, eutrophication, and plant community composition on CH4 emissions from an estuarine tidal wetland. Changes in CH4 emissions with SLR are primarily mediated by shifts in plant community composition and associated plant traits that determine both the direction and magnitude of SLR effects on CH4 emissions. We furthermore show strong stimulation of CH4 emissions by elevated atmospheric CO2, whereas effects of eutrophication are not significant. Overall, our findings demonstrate a high sensitivity of CH4 emissions to global change with important implications for modeling greenhouse-gas dynamics of blue C ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Climate change is identified as a major threat to wetlands. Altered hydrology and rising temperature can change the biogeochemistry and function of a wetland to the degree that some important services might be turned into disservices. This means that they will, for example, no longer provide a water purification service and adversely they may start to decompose and release nutrients to the surface water. Moreover, a higher rate of decomposition than primary production (photosynthesis) may lead to a shift of their function from being a sink of carbon to a source. This review paper assesses the potential response of natural wetlands (peatlands) and constructed wetlands to climate change in terms of gas emission and nutrients release. In addition, the impact of key climatic factors such as temperature and water availability on wetlands has been reviewed. The authors identified the methodological gaps and weaknesses in the literature and then introduced a new framework for conducting a comprehensive mesocosm experiment to address the existing gaps in literature to support future climate change research on wetland ecosystems. In the future, higher temperatures resulting in drought might shift the role of both constructed wetland and peatland from a sink to a source of carbon. However, higher temperatures accompanied by more precipitation can promote photosynthesis to a degree that might exceed the respiration and maintain the carbon sink role of the wetland. There might be a critical water level at which the wetland can preserve most of its services. In order to find that level, a study of the key factors of climate change and their interactions using an appropriate experimental method is necessary. Some contradictory results of past experiments can be associated with different methodologies, designs, time periods, climates, and natural variability. Hence a long-term simulation of climate change for wetlands according to the proposed framework is recommended. This framework provides relatively more accurate and realistic simulations, valid comparative results, comprehensive understanding and supports coordination between researchers. This can help to find a sustainable management strategy for wetlands to be resilient to climate change.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in utilizing the high carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands as a rationale for their restoration, but this requires careful assessment of their greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. We used a spatially extensive sampling approach across salinity gradients and management regimes (disturbed, restored, and reference) in 22 wetland sites across two Oregon, USA estuaries, Tillamook and Coos Bays, to measure fluxes of methane (CH4), ecosystem respiration as carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) over 1 year and related them to environmental forcing variables. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models explained drivers of GHG fluxes reasonably well despite highly nonlinear and interactive relationships and many flux measurements below detection. We used the BRT models to predict annual GHG fluxes in a subset of restored and reference sites where continuous environmental data were recorded and compared them to previously published soil carbon sequestration rates. Most sites had net removal of CO2-equivalents from the atmosphere over both 20 and 100 year timeframes. Our results show that a spatially extensive GHG flux sampling scheme and machine-learning statistical techniques can be used to estimate GHG fluxes in other current and former wetlands within the region if environmental data are collected at a spatial resolution that reflects site variability and at sufficient duration to reflect seasonality (i.e., at least one full year). Such an approach can save time and money in determining the feasibility of wetland restoration as a climate mitigation strategy. We use our results to suggest wetland restoration strategies that optimize climate benefits.},

  abstract = {Tidal wetlands play an important role in global carbon cycling by storing carbon in sediment at millennial time scales, transporting dissolved carbon into coastal waters, and contributing significantly to global CH4 budgets. However, these ecosystems' greenhouse gas monitoring and predictions are challenging due to spatial heterogeneity and tidal flooding. We utilized eddy covariance and chamber measurements to quantify fluxes of CO2 and CH4 at a restored tidal saltmarsh across spatial and temporal scales. Eddy covariance data revealed that the site was a strong net sink for CO2 (-387 g C-CO2 m-2 yr-1, SD = 46) and a small net source of CH4 (0.7 g C-CH4 m-2 yr-1, SD = 0.4). After partitioning net ecosystem exchange of CO2 into gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, we found that high net uptake of CO2 was due to low respiration emissions rather than high photosynthetic rates. We also found that respiration rates varied between land covers with increased respiration in mudflats compared to vegetated areas. Daytime soil chamber measurements revealed that the greatest CO2 emission was from higher elevation mudflat soils (0.5 {$\mu$}mol m-2s-1, SE = 1.3) and CH4 emission was greatest from lower elevation Spartina foliosa soils (1.6 nmol m-2s-1, SD = 8.2). Overall, these results highlight the importance of the relationships between wetland plant community and elevation, and inundation for CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Future research should include the use of high-resolution imagery, automated chambers, and a focus on quantifying carbon exported in tidal waters.},

  abstract = {Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems in the response strategy to climate change, through carbon sequestration (CS). Nevertheless, their current CS potential is declining due to human disturbance, with further decrease expected under global population growth and climate change scenarios. Literature has documented various measures that seek to enhance CS by wetlands and therefore enable these ecosystems remain vital in global carbon (C) balance and climate change mitigation. The objective of this review is to critically analyse these measures with respect to their feasibility and impact on wetland functioning, both in ecological and socio-economic perspectives. In doing this, we strive to address the concerns of wetland scientists, managers and other stakeholders pertaining CS by wetlands. Findings indicate that CS can be enhanced through both non-manipulative and manipulative measures. Non-manipulative measures aim at enhancing CS by increasing wetlands' spatial extent, while manipulative ones aim at altering characteristics of certain wetland components that influence CS. Their overall target is to increase organic matter input, apportion C to longer-lived pools, and increase residence times of C pools. Based on the identified research gaps, we recommend that CS actions for wetlands should prioritize conservation of existing natural wetlands. Additional measures should consider associated risks such as those on wetland flora and fauna, soil and hydrological regimes, and competing services. We further believe that successful implementation of non-manipulative measures for CS will require attachment of economic incentives that are not only foreseeable, but also adequate to match returns from competing land uses.},

  abstract = {There is substantial interest in restoring tidal wetlands because of their high rates of long-term soil carbon sequestration and other valued ecosystem services. However, these wetlands are sometimes net sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) that may offset their climate cooling potential. GHG fluxes vary widely within and across tidal wetlands, so it is essential to better understand how key environmental drivers, and importantly, land management, affect GHG dynamics. We measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes at 26 reference and restored tidal wetland sites and eight nontidal pastures (mostly diked former tidal wetlands) in five estuaries in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA. We measured fluxes 7--8 times over one year to assess the effects of environmental drivers, wetland type, and land management on CH4 and N2O fluxes. Linear relationships between CH4 fluxes and environmental drivers were poor, but a machine-learning approach with boosted regression trees provided strong predictability for fluxes based upon wetland surface elevation, water-table level, and salinity. Less important variables were groundwater pH, wetland type, and temperature. Under oligohaline conditions, CH4 fluxes were variable and sometimes very high, but fluxes at salinities above 2 ppt were relatively low on an annual basis. Fluxes of CH4 were higher in restored tidal marshes and wet pastures than in reference tidal marshes, tidal swamps, and dry pastures. The N2O model had lower predictive power than the CH4 model, with wetland type as the most important factor, although N2O fluxes across all wetland types were low (median of zero). Our results indicate that estuarine hydrologic gradients are a key driver of CH4 fluxes and that wetland land use impacts on CH4 fluxes are largely mediated by their varying environmental conditions. In the PNW, estuarine wetlands that have low salinity, lower elevation, and have high water tables are more likely to have increased CH4 emissions that may offset their carbon sequestration benefits until they gain enough elevation through accretion. This study also provides a transferrable modeling approach to predict the consequences of coastal wetland management on GHG fluxes using monitoring data from a limited set of key environmental drivers.},

  abstract = {Fluxes of greenhouse gases are a critical component of the earth's natural climate, but anthropogenic emissions have created an imbalance and resulted in global climate change. Quantifying the emission of these gases is vital to our understanding of their sources and sinks, both natural and anthropogenic. The static chamber method, in which a system of interest is enclosed, and gas concentrations are measured over time, is widely used to estimate fluxes of greenhouse gases. With the development of instruments such as infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs) supporting high-frequency concentration data, there is a growing need for open-source workflows to calculate fluxes. Here we present fluxfinder, an R package designed to support reproducible calculations and processing of greenhouse gas fluxes measured with the static chamber method. The package includes raw data file parsing from widely used IRGAs, metadata matching, unit conversion, flux estimations, and initial quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC). Diagnostic graphical plots provide a transparent way to differentiate between measurement issues and nonlinear behavior. The package is also designed to be easily integrated with the gasfluxes package for further fitting of nonlinear concentration-time models, allowing alternative or additional flux QA/QC. The fluxfinder package offers a flexible workflow that is easily adaptable to promote open and reproducible greenhouse gas flux estimations.},
